# Real-Time Speech Processor

## Project Overview
The Real-Time Speech Processor is a Python application that captures speech, transcribes it into text, corrects the text for grammar and clarity, and then converts it back into speech. Using advanced machine learning models like Wav2Vec 2.0 for speech recognition and BERT for text correction, this project aims to provide an efficient solution for real-time audio processing.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use Python 3.7 or higher.

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio numpy torch transformers gtts
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure your microphone is connected and recognized by your system.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python real_time_speech_processor.py
   ```

3. The application will list available audio input devices. Choose the appropriate one for your needs.

4. Speaking into the microphone will initiate the real-time processing, where your speech will be captured, transcribed, corrected, and spoken back to you.

5. You can stop the processing at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Features

- **Real-Time Speech Capture**: Capture audio seamlessly from your microphone.
- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken words into text using the Wav2Vec 2.0 model.
- **Text Correction**: Improve the transcription accuracy using a BERT language model and a text generation pipeline.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Convert the corrected text back to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports audio playback on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- `pyaudio`: For audio input and output.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations on audio data.
- `torch`: For handling deep learning models.
- `transformers`: For loading and using pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2 and BERT.
- `gtts`: For converting text to speech.

Make sure to install all dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.
